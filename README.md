# Rainbow
Rainbow is a small utility based on [Basti's OLED-Saver](https://github.com/super-toq/OLED-Saver) designed to revive frozen or "stuck" LCD pixels. It repeatedly sends color signals to the screen, aiming to resolve stuck sub-pixels and reduce temporary ghosting effects.
Caution: Never apply this or similar programs on OLED displays. Improper use of such a program (Pixel Refresher) can damage your display!

## Health warning:
Rapid colour changes can cause headaches, dizziness, or light sensitivity in susceptible individuals.  
Do not look at the flashing image — it may trigger migraine or epilepsy in sensitive users.  
Look away and turn off the tool immediately if any discomfort occurs.
